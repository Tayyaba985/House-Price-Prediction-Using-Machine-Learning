🏡 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and other relevant parameters. The goal is to build an accurate regression model that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in estimating property values.

📊 Project Overview

* Objective: Predict the price of a house using supervised learning techniques
* Dataset: Cleaned and preprocessed housing dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or custom source)
* Approach: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Model Training, Evaluation

🧠 Technologies & Tools

* Languages: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* Algorithms Used:
  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
  * Gradient Boosting Regressor (optional)
* Model Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score

📦 Features

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Feature Selection and Encoding
